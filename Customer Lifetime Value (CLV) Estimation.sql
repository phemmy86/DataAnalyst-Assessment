## Question 5: Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation

**Approach:**  
1. Calculate each userâ€™s tenure in months using `TIMESTAMPDIFF` between `date_joined` and today.  
2. Count only successful, positive-amount savings transactions.  
3. Compute monthly transaction rate: `total_transactions / tenure_months`.  
4. Annualize it (`* 12`) and multiply by average transaction value (in thousands: `confirmed_amount/100 * 0.001`).  
5. Round the final CLV to two decimals.  
6. Exclude users with zero tenure and order by highest CLV.

**Challenges & Resolutions:**  
- Avoid division by zero by using `GREATEST(...,1)`.  
- Ensuring currency and units conversion (cents to thousands) is explicit and correct.
